"""2D combinatorial quantum gravity (CQG): Monte Carlo on incompressible graphs.

Model, as we read it from the sources (keys in REFERENCES.bib). Q1-Q3 were
checked against the text of [T25] and [KTB19] on 2026-09-19; see ASSUMPTIONS.md.

* Configuration space: 4-regular graphs on N vertices in which short cycles
  (triangles, squares, pentagons) share at most one edge ("incompressible" /
  hard-core condition) [T25 Def. 2 and Fig. 1; T22; T24 Eq. (1)].
* Energy: total Ollivier-Ricci curvature, H = -2D sum_i sum_{j~i} kappa(ij)
  [T25 Eq. (21)], with edge curvature
  kappa = T/2D - [1-(2+T+S)/2D]_+ - [1-(2+T+S+P)/2D]_+  [T25 Eq. (8)].
* Simplification used in the published simulations: bipartite graphs only, so
  no triangles or pentagons can occur [T25; T24; KTB19 Sec. 4].
* Weight exp(-H/g) with g the dimensionless coupling, playing the role of
  temperature [T25 Eq. (20)].

ASSUMPTION Q1 (energy; [T25 Eqs. (8), (21)] at D = 2 with T = P = 0):
    kappa(e) = -(2 - S_e)_+ / 2,
    H = 4 sum_e (2 - S_e)_+  =  16 (N - S) + 4 X,     X = sum_e (S_e - 2)_+ .
  S is the number of squares, S_e the number on edge e, and X counts the
  surplus squares on edges that carry more than two. 16 (N - S) is the "global"
  term, 4 X the "local" one [T25 Eq. (22)]. Checks: a random graph (S ~ 0)
  has H = 16N; the flat torus (S = N, X = 0) has H = 0; the 4-cube (N = 16,
  S = 24, every S_e = 3, so X = 32) has H = -128 + 128 = 0, the degeneracy
  stated in [T25].

THE LAMBDA FAMILY (VISION, first knob; the interpolation is ours):
    H = 16 (N - S) + 4 lam X .
  lam = 0   global term only. Published: first order, hypercubes [T25; GV21].
  lam = 1   the full Ollivier curvature [T25 Eq. (22)].
  cap = 2   edges with S_e > 2 forbidden outright, which is lam -> infinity.
            This is the model simulated in [KTB19 Sec. 4] (Q3). X is then
            always zero and H = 16 (N - S) whatever lam is.

ASSUMPTION Q2 (hard-core rule): in a bipartite graph two distinct squares can
  share two edges only if the edges are adjacent, which makes a K_{2,3}. So
  "incompressible" is equivalent to "no two vertices have more than two common
  neighbours". Confirmed: K_{2,3} is excluded subgraph (b) of [T25 Fig. 1].
  Consequence used below: an edge carries at most 2D - 1 = 3 squares. (A square
  u-v-a-b on edge (u,v) uses a common neighbour b of u and a other than v, and
  there is at most one.) Hence "no cap" and "cap = 3" are the same thing.

ASSUMPTION Q3 (the cap is optional): cap = CAP = 2 gives the [KTB19 Sec. 4]
  model, cap = NO_CAP the space of [T25]. Without the cap the 4x4 torus, which
  is the 4-cube, is a valid state, so torus() allows a side of 4 there.

ASSUMPTION Q4 (move and acceptance): bipartite edge switch
  (u1,v1),(u2,v2) -> (u1,v2),(u2,v1). [KTB19 Sec. 4] says "edge switches";
  details not given there. The proposal is symmetric: two edges are chosen
  uniformly, and the reverse move picks the two new edges with the same
  probability. Moves leading outside the configuration space are rejected.
  Two acceptance rules are offered, with a = exp(-dH / g):
      Metropolis   p = min(1, a)                    [NB99]
      Glauber      p = 1 / (1 + 1/a)                [T25 Eq. (28)]
  Both satisfy p(dH) / p(-dH) = a, which with a symmetric proposal is detailed
  balance, so both sample exp(-H/g); they differ only in how fast. Ergodicity
  inside the constrained space is proved by exhaustive listing for N <= 18 and
  unproven beyond (Q9; small_graphs.py). Connectedness is not enforced.

  How dH is obtained exactly. dS: squares lost are those through the removed
  edges, squares gained those through the added ones, and no square contains
  both removed or both added edges (it would need the other pair as well). dX:
  S_e can change only on an edge of a lost or a gained square. Those edges are
  listed, X is summed over the list in the new graph, the move is switched
  back, X is summed over the same list in the old graph, and the move is
  switched forward again. Edges absent from a graph contribute nothing.

ASSUMPTION Q5 (start state): an lx x ly periodic square lattice, both sides
  even and >= 6 under the cap (>= 4 without it), melted by running at infinite
  temperature. Ours.
