"""Sealed and leaky runs: the energy given off stays in the system, or escapes at a chosen rate.

WHY. Every run so far has been at a fixed temperature, which means an unlimited bath:
the energy a conversion gives off is carried away at once and can do nothing. VISION
claims 5 and 6 are about what happens when it does not. The author put the three cases
plainly (design brief, "what happens to the released energy"):

    wide open      the energy is carried away              our other runs
    semi-permeable it leaks out at a limited rate          leak between 0 and 1 here
    sealed         it all stays                            leak = 0 here

THE METHOD [Creutz 1983, from general knowledge, not read by us; the standard
"demon"]. Beside the graph we keep one number, the DEMON, which holds energy and is
never allowed to go negative. A switch with energy change dH is accepted exactly when
the demon can pay for it, dH <= demon; then demon -= dH. A move that lowers the
graph's energy hands the difference to the demon, which can then spend it on later
moves. Nothing else changes: the same moves, the same configuration space, the same
validity rules as cqg.run_chain.

WHAT IS EXACT. H + demon + (whatever has leaked) never changes, to the last bit: the
run conserves energy by construction, which is the bookkeeping VISION claim 6 asks
for. With leak = 0 nothing escapes, so H + demon is fixed. Both are tested.

WHY A DEMON IS ENOUGH. At fixed total energy the graph alone is not a Markov chain:
without somewhere to put the energy, only moves with dH = 0 could ever be accepted.
The demon is the smallest thing that fixes this, and it is not a fudge: the standard
result is that the demon's own energy settles into the distribution exp(-demon/g),
where g is the temperature the graph has reached by itself, so the run MEASURES the
temperature instead of being told it (`demon_temperature` below).

ASSUMPTION Q12 (ours: the leak). After each sweep the demon keeps a fraction
(1 - leak) of its energy and the rest is counted as gone. leak = 0 is sealed;
leak = 1 removes everything given off, as fast as it appears. In between, what
happens is a race between how fast energy is released and how fast it escapes, which
is the author's semi-permeable wall. The leak is a choice of protocol, not of model,
and must be declared before a run like any other knob (VISION S1).
