"""How many renamings leave every relationship intact: the fast count (ASSUMPTIONS Q15, addendum).

WHY. Treating points as interchangeable weights each arrangement by its number of symmetries A, the
renamings of the points that keep every edge (Q15). The project's first counter
(`small_graphs.log_automorphisms`, networkx isomorphism search) takes 1 to 45 seconds per count at
N = 64 to 160, which rules out using A inside a chain. This one calls igraph's `count_automorphisms`
(the bliss algorithm, from general knowledge; not read by us) and takes about a millisecond at the same
sizes, with the same answers (tests/test_symmetry.py checks it against the slow counter).

WHAT IS COUNTED. Renamings that map each side of the bipartition to itself, exactly as Q15 counts them
(the slow counter works on graphs renumbered by `sides_first` and keeps the sides apart); the sides are
passed to igraph as vertex colours.
