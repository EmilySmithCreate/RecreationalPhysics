"""The twisted-diagonal state: the owner's particles as loops of diagonals on the cubic torus, with twist, curl and spin,
and the readers of her rules (docs/design/twisted_diagonals_build_2026-10-30.md; the standing sheet
docs/design/twist_curl_rules_current.md). Her Option B: particles are loops of twisted diagonals built as variables; the
wiring's knots are the scrap. Nothing here is derived; the rules are put in and read back exactly.

The lattice: points of an L x L x L torus, coloured by the parity of x + y + z. A box diagonal is a signed permutation of
(1, 1, 2) (24 steps, sqrt 6, same colour); a long diagonal (1, 1, 2m), m >= 2 (holds curl, no twist); a face diagonal a
signed permutation of (1, 1, 0) (12 steps, sqrt 2, dark twist in halves). Body diagonals (1, 1, 1) change colour (8 steps,
sqrt 3) and carry the photon (her first form of 30 October, evening): not a loop but an open path along one body diagonal,
with half a curl, spin 1, no twist, moving one link per sweep, the angle of its curl turning a quarter turn per link so
that it repeats every four links. Its readers: charge 0, net twist 0, curl +1/2 or -1/2, spin +1 or -1.

A Loop: closed on the torus, one step kind, twist on each diagonal (thirds on box, halves on face, zero on long), an
non-zero integer curl (signed from 30 October, evening: the anti-particle's loop has the opposite curl, so that a
particle's curl can net zero, her neutrino), and a spin in {-1/2, 0, +1/2} that may be non-zero only if some twist is
present (her rule of 30 October: spin needs twist present, not net twist). A loop may also hold an excitation (her
decision of 30 October, evening): the photons it has absorbed, each holding its half curl and its spin 1 on the loop until
the loop re-emits a photon; the absorbed spin is carried as orbital motion (a part of its own, `orb`), not as the loop's
spin, following the published fact that an electron's spin stays 1/2 when it moves up a level. A Particle is a named set
of loops. Readers: charge = sum of twist; spin = |sum of loop spins|; mass_count = number of looped diagonals (a long
diagonal counts one); parts = (L, n, tau+, T, s, C, orb), with C including the held half curls and orb the held spins;
net_twist over a set of particles, the quantity pair creation conserves; ledger over particles and photons sums T, C, s,
orb, J = s + orb and n.

Twist values are kept as Fractions so that thirds and halves are exact.
