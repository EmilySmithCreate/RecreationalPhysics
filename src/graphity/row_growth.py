"""Space that grows by whole rows: the owner's growth rule for PREREGISTRATION T76.

Naming. The energy is the toy's, H = 16 (N - S) + 4 lam X (cqg.py, Q1), four links per point, no cap. T76 runs it at
lam = 1.25: at lam != 1 this is our family around the published model, never combinatorial quantum gravity (VISION
Update 22).

THE STATE. A four-link graph whose points carry grid labels: point p has coordinates (x, y) on an Lx x Ly torus,
and every coordinate pair belongs to exactly one point (`at[x, y]` is that point). The labels are given once, by the
flat torus the run starts from (cqg.torus numbering, point i at divmod(i, Ly)), and they stay with the points while
the chain rewires the links: a label says where a point sat in the grid, not what it is linked to now. Rows are the
sets of points sharing one coordinate: along axis 0, row i is the Ly points with x = i; along axis 1, the Lx points
with y = i. W is the length of a row (Ly along axis 0, Lx along axis 1). The two sides of the bipartition are
part = (x + y) % 2, and an insertion keeps that true.

THE GROWTH RULE (T76, "Design", the owner's words of VISION Update 75; the precise readings below are ours). A pair of
rows may go between rows i and i + 1 (mod L) along an axis when
  (i)  the grid is intact across that boundary: every point of row i is still linked to its partner in row i + 1,
       the point with the same other coordinate; and
  (ii) the corridor is clear: no link with an endpoint within `reach` (3) steps of a point of row i or row i + 1,
       distance counted along the links of the current graph, sits on more than two squares (S_e > 2, a "curled"
       link). *Ours:* "a link within three steps" is read as a link with at least one endpoint at graph distance at
       most 3; the stricter reading (both endpoints) would allow a few more insertions.
The insertion cuts the W links across the boundary and puts two new rows a, b between: row i - a - b - row i + 1,
with straight links across (p - a_y, a_y - b_y, b_y - q) and links along each new row (a_y - a_{y+1}, b_y - b_{y+1},
round the torus). Every old point keeps four links (it trades its partner across the boundary for a new point), every
new point has four. The new rows' sides alternate, so the graph stays two-sided; the coordinates along the axis
beyond i move up by 2 and the length L along that axis grows by 2. Valid whenever W >= 6: an old pair of points
gains no common neighbour, and a new point's common neighbours with any point are at most two (worked through in
the tests, which check cqg.is_valid without the cap). The new points have the numbers N .. N + 2W - 1.

THE GROWTH STEP. Every boundary along both axes that exists when the step begins is offered once, in an order drawn
from the step's numpy Generator. A boundary is remembered by one point of its lower row, so that insertions made
earlier in the same step, which renumber coordinates, do not change which pair of rows it names; boundaries created
by the step's own insertions are not offered until the next step. *Exact consequence:* on a clean sheet every one of
an axis's L boundaries takes a pair, so one step can take L to 3L along both axes and N to up to 9N. Each candidate is checked against the graph as it
stands at the moment it is offered (the curled links are recomputed after every insertion). With `stop_at` given, the
step offers nothing more once N >= stop_at (T76's stop, "when N reaches 8 times its starting value", read as
stopping at once, mid-step if need be: ours).

THE DRIVER (run_growth). Settling: n_settle fair sweeps of the chain with growth off. Growth: then each fair sweep is
one block of the chain followed by one growth step, until N >= cap_factor * N0 or n_growth fair sweeps have passed.
A reading is taken before any attempt and after every fair sweep: N, Lx, Ly, S, X, D = sum_e max(0, 2 - S_e) (the
missing squares), rho = D / N, the share of links with S_e > 2, the rows added in that fair sweep, and the block's
acceptance.

The fair clock (ASSUMPTIONS O90). One fair sweep is N / n_ref sweeps of 2N attempts, 2 N^2 / n_ref attempts, with N
the number of points when the block starts. The remainder is carried from block to block as an exact integer, so at
a fixed N the attempts after k fair sweeps are exactly floor(2 N^2 k / n_ref), as in coupled.fair_sweep_schedule; when
N changes the carry goes on with the new N.

The chain. `_attempts` is cqg.run_chain's inner loop, line for line (Metropolis; the same four integer draws per
attempt and a uniform draw only when dH > 0; cqg's helpers for the move and for dS, dX), run for a given number of
attempts rather than whole sweeps of 2N, so that a fair sweep need not be a whole number of sweeps. Its random stream
is numba's, seeded once at the start of the run and carried on through every block (seed < 0, as in run_chain:
re-seeding in short blocks is what Q14 warns against). With growth off and a whole number of chain sweeps in total
it is therefore cqg.run_chain on the same seed, bit for bit (tested). The chain's detailed balance is cqg's (Q4).
The growth step uses a separate numpy Generator; both are drawn from one SeedSequence (`seed`), so a run is fixed by
its seed.

NO DETAILED BALANCE IS CLAIMED FOR THE GROWTH STEP. It only adds points and never removes them; the run is not an
equilibrium sampler of anything once growth starts, and is not meant to be. What T76 reads is how the density of
missing squares evolves under this rule, chain and growth together.
