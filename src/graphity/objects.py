"""Two objects of nine squares in a four-link graph, counted exactly (PREREGISTRATION T78).

The curled ring: a square a-b-c-d each of whose four links carries three squares (the most the hard-core rule allows;
cqg.py Q2). It is the column of paper 2 in kind: on the 4 x L curled torus every ring round the short side is one. It
touches nine squares (its own and two more through each link) on twelve points and carries four surplus squares.

The flat patch: a 4 x 4 grid of sixteen distinct points with all 24 grid links present, so nine squares in a 3 x 3
block. Extra links among the sixteen points are allowed (the count is of grid monomorphisms, not induced subgraphs).
A grid is found cell by cell: the first row x[0][0..3] and the first column x[0..3][0] are walks along links, and
every other cell x[i][j] is the unique common neighbour of x[i-1][j] and x[i][j-1] other than x[i-1][j-1] (by the
hard-core rule two points have at most two common neighbours, so "the other one" is unique when it exists). Ordered
(corner, two directions) tuples are counted and divided by 8, the symmetries of a square grid acting on a 4 x 4 grid
with sixteen distinct points.

Both counts are checked in tests/test_objects.py against networkx (rings: 4-cycles whose links all carry three
squares; patches: subgraph monomorphisms of grid_2d_graph(4, 4)) and against the flat and curled tori (196 patches
and no ring on the flat 14 x 14 torus; 16 rings on the 16 x 4 curled torus).
