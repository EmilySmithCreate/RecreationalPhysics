# The series: what each paper claims, what is established, what is missing

Written 23 September 2026, night, at the owner's request ("work through each of the other pieces with
similar detail; where needed design new experiments and predictions"). One entry per paper, in the
order they depend on each other. Every claim is at the level of the model; what it would mean for the
universe is the owner's framework, stated in paper 7 with its status beside each piece.

**Status words, used the same way throughout.** *Established*: pre-registered, run, verdict on the record.
*Exact*: arithmetic or exhaustive enumeration, no sampling. *Failed*: pre-registered and the prediction did
not hold. *Designed*: pre-registered or drafted, not yet run. *Idea*: the owner's, recorded, no test yet.

## Paper 1. Metastable curled tori and their front-driven decay (drafted)

**Claim.** In the graph energy of combinatorial quantum gravity with its local term's coefficient raised
above 1 (not CQG itself, which is λ = 1 only; the author's condition of 24 September), a torus with one
direction curled is metastable and opens into flat space sharply: a memoryless start, one front, two orders
side by side, an exact release, a local push of fixed size, one leftover of fixed size.

**Status.** Established at λ = 1.25 (T7, T9, T10, T11); exact results for all λ; the λ map (T8, O38) run and
written into section V: sharp wherever the torus is stuck (1.05 to 1.35), edge between 1.35 and 1.40, verdict
inconclusive by the letter for a stated reason (the memoryless-wait criterion was too tight).

**Missing.** Only the owner's review, then the endorsement request to Carlo
(`docs/outreach/reply_draft_2026-09-23_second.md`).

**Draft.** `docs/papers/curled_torus/paper.tex`, `paper.pdf`; review page
https://claude.ai/artifact/3TcXFYr51m955zTkgitXwR.

## Paper 2. The leftover: size, number, and what makes it

**Claim to test.** The change leaves remnants of a fixed size, and their number is set by how the change
started (per seed), not by the size of the space. That is the model-level version of "dark matter is the
scrap of the change, abundant through many seeds" (VISION Update 16).

**Established.** One leftover per converted tube, however large (T10, ONE RING, HOWEVER LARGE, N up to 288);
its position is uniform, neither at the seed nor where fronts meet (T11, NEITHER); read from its wiring, it
is one column of the tube left curled, costing 24λ − 16, occasionally a two-point twist (20 units) or a
combination of small defects (8 to 45 units) (O13, O15, O28).

**Exact, new tonight (T8 pre-registration).** Near λ = 1 the column keeps a large share of the lump:
(24λ − 16)/(4(λ − 1)N), 22 % at λ = 1.25 and 72 % at λ = 1.05 for N = 64, falling with N.

**Established the same night (T17, O33): BETWEEN.** One to eight planted seeds in one tube leave 1.10, 2.15,
2.50, 3.40 leftovers on average; slope 0.29 ± 0.04 per extra seed. More seeds, more scrap, but fewer than one
each; both the owner's ONE PER SEED and our ONE PER TUBE failed. Next: where do the extra leftovers go when
fronts meet (merge, anneal)?

**Still to design.**
- *Does a leftover move?* Needed by papers 2 and 5. A column in a flat sheet, fixed coupling, followed for
  a long run; record its position every block. Cheap. Draft below (T19).
- *Does the leftover's share depend on λ as the exact formula says?* Read from T8's saved final states.

**What would have counted against the owner's picture, and did not happen.** ONE PER TUBE in T17. What did
happen is weaker than her hypothesis: the scrap grows with the number of seeds, but less than one per seed.

## Paper 3. The fertile window: which λ makes a lump, a stuck X, and a clean birth

**Claim to test.** There is a window of λ above 1 in which X is stuck for now, the change releases a lump,
and the new space can take the lump without melting; the owner's λ ≈ 1.25 sits inside it. With the rules
fixed between generations (the owner's decision of 23 September), the reason our λ is where it is would be
counting across loops, not evolution: a universe drawn at random belongs to the most prolific loop.

**Established.** At λ = 1.25: all of paper 1, and T9 (BONFIRE WITH A THRESHOLD: the new space survives only
if its surroundings can hold the lump; the needed room scales with N). At λ = 1.5: X is not stuck (T7).

**Running.** T8, the λ map of stuckness, sharpness, release and scrap.

**Measured the same night (T18, O34): PROPORTIONAL.** The room needed is 12, 36, 72 stores at λ = 1.10, 1.25,
1.40 (N = 96): it grows faster than the lump. A bigger λ gives a bigger lump and a harder birth.

**Honest limit.** The model has no black holes, so it cannot count offspring. It can map the ingredients
(stuckness, push, lump, room, scrap); fertility itself is the owner's framework.

---

## Paper 4. Closed regions: can concentrated energy re-curl space? (the black-hole piece)

**Claim to test.** In a closed region, energy concentrated into space can fold it back towards X (a black hole
in the owner's picture is a re-curled region that can "burp" a new space when it gets the activation energy).

**Established, and against.** O20: a sealed sheet given a budget of energy melts rather than folds, at every
budget and every λ tried; with named points. The exact move census (corrected 23 September): from perfect
space no single move adds a square, so a fold must run through a seam.

**Why it is the hardest.** The owner's theory has points interchangeable, and under that weighting a complete
fold (a whole closed piece, e.g. a 4-cube with 192 symmetries) gains enormously while a partial fold gains
nothing. That is the one route by which folding could win, and it is exactly the one named-points runs
cannot see. Doing it properly needs the symmetry count of every proposed state, which costs 0.1 to 24 s per
count at N = 160 with the present tool (Q15).

**Designed, and the blocking tool now exists.**
1. ~~*Exact, small.*~~ *Withdrawn the same night:* at N = 16 and 18, the only enumerable sizes, there is no flat
   sheet at all (the 4 x 4 torus is the 4-cube; the first flat torus is 6 x 6 = 36), so fold against melt cannot
   be posed there.
2. *A fast symmetry count: done (Q20).* igraph counts in about a millisecond where the old counter took up to
   45 s, agreeing exactly; a chain with interchangeable points built on it reproduces the exact interchangeable
   averages at N = 18. Per-move counting is affordable up to about N = 64.
3. *Next:* pre-register the closed-region test with the owner's prediction (her statement: open space spreads
   and heals; a closed region folds): O20's sealed sheet at N = 36 and 64, λ = 1.25, the same budgets, run with
   named and with interchangeable points side by side; the reading is the folded share of the damage.

**Measured the same night (T21, O36): MELTS EITHER WAY at N = 64**, the size where complete folds exist; a
fragile lean towards folding at N = 36 under the bath. The owner's closed-region fold is not seen for energy
spread through a box. The untested route is a local push with cold space around it.

## Paper 5. Gravity as the wish to refold: do leftovers pull on each other?

**Claim to test.** Leftovers attract at a distance through counting (entropy), and the pull depends only on
their energy, not their wiring (the equivalence principle). The owner allows kinds of dark matter to differ
slightly; ordinary matter must not (measured to one part in 10¹⁵).

**Established, exact.** No energetic force at a distance: defects sharing no square are exactly additive in
energy, with an attraction of 16 only where they touch (O22). So anything gravity-like must come from
counting.

**Designed tonight.**
- T19, *mobility*: does a leftover column move through the sheet at fixed coupling, and how far? Without
  motion there is no pull to measure by watching; with it, two columns can be released and their separation
  followed.
- *The interchangeable-points pull, exactly.* For two identical defects in a torus, the interchangeable weight
  of each placement is its symmetry count. Computable exactly for every separation. Our expectation: the
  count is large only at special placements (exactly opposite, aligned), so the "force" it makes is a set of
  preferred symmetric placements, not a smooth attraction. If so, that is a clean negative for the simplest
  version of the mechanism, and it should be said.
- **Run the same night (O32), and it came out that way:** at 18 separations in a 12 x 12 torus, two identical
  simple defects have 1 or 2 symmetries at every ordinary distance and 4 only when exactly opposite. No pull;
  a factor-2 preference for maximum separation. What remains open is the entropic force when the surroundings
  are free to rearrange, which the interchangeable chain (Q20) can now measure.

**What would count against.** Immobile leftovers, or a pull that depends on wiring for defects of equal energy.

## Paper 6. Quantum behaviour from counting versions

**Claim (VISION Update 17).** Superposition is the set of undetectably different versions of the world;
measurement is an interaction that makes them distinguishable.

**Status, plainly: the weakest leg.**
- Rung 0 (T15): INCONCLUSIVE by the letter; versions exist in the parts, and in a world with three different
  things there is exactly one, as in a melt.
- Rung 3a: CLASSICAL for every arrangement, by argument. Counting versions of one fixed arrangement is a
  hidden-variable theory and cannot violate Bell. The owner's prediction failed.
- Rung 0b: the loop of four is not a resonator in the sheet. Prediction failed.

**What the reading of Smolin adds (23 September).** His real-ensemble quantum mechanics ([Smolin11]) gets
Schrödinger's equation from real copies that *interact* (a non-local copy rule) and carry a *phase*. Those
are exactly the two ingredients the counting lacks. His "classical because it has no copies" matches rung 0.
And there is a prediction that separates the owner from him: a system unique in the universe but isolated
and symmetric should behave quantum-mechanically for her and not for him.

**Next, needing no decision.** Rung 1: do the chain's time-fractions equal the counts in the interchangeable
ensemble at N = 16 and 18? Validation, exact. Draft pre-registration below (T20).

**Needing the owner's decision first.** Whether to add an interaction among versions (Smolin's route, a new
rule, VISION decision under S1); whether to redefine the object as the cap; whether Part V of the public page
is restated.

---

## Paper 7. The framework, for the public page

**What it is.** The owner's claims 1 to 6 and the cosmological cycle, each with a status box: which paper
tests it, the verdict, and what would count against it. Told in her words, with every claim saying whose it is.

**What it must not be.** A claim that the framework is established. Today one piece is established (paper 1),
several are designed or running, and the quantum leg has failed as stated. VISION S5 (a physicist has read it)
is not met.

**Can it be published within a week?** Paper 1 as a preprint: yes, if Carlo or another physicist endorses.
Papers 2 and 3: possibly, if T17, T18 and T8 come out clean and the owner reviews them. Papers 4 to 6: not
honestly within a week; they can be published as a *programme*, with their tests named and their current
status shown, which is a stronger thing to publish than a framework stated as settled.

---

## Draft pre-registrations written tonight

T17 (leftover per seed) is committed and running. T18 (room needed against λ) is committed before its runs
(see PREREGISTRATION.md). T19 (leftover mobility) and T20 (quantum rung 1) are drafted in this file only, for
the owner's predictions in the morning; nothing is run under them.

### T19 (pre-registered and run): ANNEALS at every coupling (O35)

Take the final states of T10 or T17 that hold exactly one curled column in an otherwise flat torus. Continue
each at λ = 1.25 and g = 1.5 (and a warmer g = 2.0) for 100,000 sweeps, recording every 500 sweeps the
columns of the vertices at d = 1. Observable: the column position's mean squared displacement against time,
and whether the leftover survives. Predictions for the owner: (a) it moves (diffuses) at g = 1.5; (b) it
moves only at the warmer coupling; (c) it does not move before it anneals away or at all. Ours: (c) at
g = 1.5, since T10's leftovers stayed in place over 30,000 sweeps in a cold box; unknown at 2.0.

### Quantum rung 1 (pre-registered as T15 rung 1): AGREES (O37)

As `docs/design/quantum_loop_design.md` rung 1: at N = 16 and 18, the interchangeable-ensemble probability of
each class (exact, from the counts) against the chain's long-run time-fraction with the renaming correction
applied per recorded configuration. Prediction (validation, not physics): agreement within sampling error.

## Night of 24 September 2026: what was launched, and who to ask, per paper

Written at the owner's request to move the programme's pieces to measured status, with the predictions inferred
from her stated positions (marked so in `PREREGISTRATION.md` until she confirms them). American spelling from
here on, at her request.

### Launched tonight (all pre-registered first)

| Test | Paper | Piece | What it settles | Where it runs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T24 | 1 (and the programme's piece 2) | 2 | The λ map with the energy check read from each decay's saved wiring, so a thermal excitation cannot fail a cell | AWS Batch, 28 jobs, via the new push-triggered queue |
| T25 | 2 | 6 | The scrap race: does the leftover freeze in when the box cools faster than it heals | laptop, 6 jobs |
| T26 | 4 | 8 | The local spark: energy in one vertex's store, or disorder in one patch, in a cold sealed sheet; named and interchangeable points | laptop, 8 jobs |
| T27 | 4 | 8 | T21's melt with its energy draining at four leak rates: does it fold before it flattens | laptop, 5 jobs |

### Who to ask, with what data (public names, public questions; the private correspondence stays in `docs/outreach/`)

The owner's rules apply (memory, 23 September): one narrow question the recipient can answer, a bias toward
UVA so a coffee is possible, the AI disclosure sentence, and a check of the recipient's 2024 to 2026 papers
before the letter is drafted. Nothing below has been sent; each is a candidate with the question and the data
that would go with it.

| Paper | Candidate | The question, in one line | The data to attach |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1, curled torus | Marija Vucelja (UVA Physics; physics of sampling, Metropolis dynamics on graphs) | For a single-move barrier under a local switch chain, is a transmission coefficient near 0.6 that does not change with the barrier height what she would expect, and is there a standard way to estimate it from the move set? | T22's table (O39): first exit on time in all six cells, κ = 0.56 to 0.68 from λ = 1.05 to 1.25 |
| 2, the relic | Carlo Trugenberger (the model's author; he named the lifetime of allotropes as his question) | How long does a stuck region last at λ = 1, and does a cooling schedule freeze it in? He asked the first half; T19 and T25 answer it for the relic at λ > 1 | T19's annealing times (O35) and T25's freeze-out time, once read; the allotrope's adjacency list is already requested (his reply pending) |
| 3, the fertile window | Diana Vaman (UVA Physics; composite and emergent gravity) | The λ deformation is the published curvature plus a penalty on a third square per edge: is there a continuum counterpart to adding such a local term to a discrete Einstein–Hilbert action, and what would it do at large scale? | The exact edge-by-edge form H = 4 Σ_e [(2 − S_e) + λ (S_e − 2)₊], the dimension ladder (O41), and T18's room-against-λ (O34) |
| 4, the black-hole piece | Kent Yagi (UVA Physics; with Brustein and Medved treated the black-hole interior as a different state of matter) | If a collapsed region were an ordered re-curled arrangement rather than a random one, which observable in ringdown or tidal response would notice the difference? | T26 and T27's verdict (fold, melt, or heal), once read; O20 and T21 as the spread-energy baseline |
| 5, curve-first gravity | Diana Vaman, or Adam Solomon (UVA; modified gravity, Love numbers) | Held until the three-dimensional model passes its reproduction gate; no 2D number is carried into a claim about gravity (the owner's decision) | O22 (no energetic force at a distance, exact) and O32 (no counting pull at fixed wiring) as the negative baseline |
| 6, quantum from counting | Samson Abramsky (UCL) or Rui Soares Barbosa (INL) for the argument; Trey Boone (UVA Philosophy) for its form | Is the argument of rung 3a sound as stated: that a renaming of a fixed arrangement fixes or swaps each loop's pairs at once and so is a noncontextual instruction set? | PREREGISTRATION T15 rung 3a and O29; the exact renaming counts of Q15 and O28 |
| companion, six links (piece 11) | Carlo Trugenberger | [T22] Fig. 3's protocol, its Boltzmann weight and whether its graphs are bipartite (held for his next reply; one question at a time) | O43: our curve under both readings of the axis, and the shapes |
| piece 12, the allotrope | Eryk Kopczyński (drew [T25] Fig. 9; RogueViz) | The adjacency list of the drawn allotrope | The exact statement that if no edge carries three squares the local term vanishes and its stability does not depend on λ |

### Status of each paper after tonight's launches

- **Paper 1:** drafted; T24 will replace T23 in section V if it reads clean, and the memoryless claim then rests on
  a run whose gates were all fixed before it ran.
- **Paper 2:** T10, T11, T17, T19 on the record; T25 running. Drafted tonight (`docs/papers/relic/paper.tex`) with
  T25's section left as the pre-registered question.
- **Paper 3:** T8, T18, T22, T23 on the record; O41 exact. Drafted tonight (`docs/papers/fertile_window/paper.tex`).
- **Paper 4:** O20, T21 on the record; T26 and T27 running. Not drafted: its first result is tonight's.
- **Paper 5:** waits on the six-link gate. **Paper 6:** waits on the owner's decision about a rule for canceling
  versions. **Paper 7:** the programme page, kept current.

## The gravity path (paper 5), sketched 24 September 2026, night, at the owner's asking

The owner's test, in her terms: **does curved space move matter?** Everything below is design; nothing is
pre-registered or run, and the dynamic rungs wait on the six-link gate (Gate C′). The exact rungs need no gate.

1. **Exact, no run: the energetic interaction of two relics in a flat 3D torus.** The 2D result (O22) is that H is
   a sum of per-edge terms, so two defects sharing no square are exactly additive, with a term of 16 only where
   they touch. The same arithmetic on a 6 × 6 × 6 torus with two curled columns at every separation. Expected:
   the same (no force at a distance). A pull here would be a surprise and would change everything below.
2. **Exact, no run: the counting pull at fixed wiring.** O32's measurement in 3D: the symmetry count of the torus
   with two identical relics at every separation, with the fast counter (Q20). Expected, as in 2D: a count that
   is large only at special placements, so no smooth attraction. Both rungs are a day's work and settle whether
   anything gravity-like can come from the arrangement alone.
3. **T28, the dynamic pull (the real test; pre-register with her prediction first).** Two relics in a 3D torus
   (6 × 6 × 6 or 8 × 8 × 8) at λ in the 3D window (1 < λ < 1.2, O41) or at 1.25 for one curled direction, held at a
   coupling where the sheet rearranges but does not melt (the first job is to find that window, as the programme
   says), with interchangeable points (her theory's weighting; per-move counting is affordable to about N = 216
   with igraph at a millisecond a count). Observable: the distribution of the separation over a long run, which
   gives the potential of mean force F(r) = −g ln P(r) up to a constant. Predictions on offer: (a) F falls with
   r decreasing (a pull), and by the same amount for two relics of equal energy but different wiring (the
   equivalence principle); (b) F is flat (no pull); (c) F rises (a push). What would earn the name gravity, from
   the programme: attractive, growing with the energy present, the same for every kind of relic, and weakening
   with distance roughly as 1/r² in 3D. A named-points control runs beside it, so that any pull can be
   attributed to counting or to the energy.
4. **The curling half, her way round: does the space around a relic curve using the relic's energy?** Read on
   the same runs: the local-dimension census and the square deficit as a function of distance from a relic,
   against the flat torus. If the deficit reaches beyond the relic's own vertices and scales with its energy,
   that is curvature sourced by matter, in the model's terms.

What blocks step 3 today: the six-link kernel's reproduction gate (rule 2), and a coupling window for a 3D sheet
that rearranges without melting, which nobody has measured. What does not block steps 1 and 2: nothing.

### 25 September, early morning: verdicts and the 3D launch

- **Paper 2:** T25 read, FREEZES IN, t* = 30,000 sweeps (O47). The paper's section 7 can now be written from the record.
- **Paper 4:** T27 read, STAYS MELTED (O48); T26 at 21 of 22 cells, all MELTED [corrected: 27 cells, 26 melted, one healed; O64], the owner's confirmed prediction heading
  for a fail. The next version of the black-hole question is three-dimensional (the fold she means is of three
  intertwined directions), after T30 shows what a curled region looks like at six links.
- **Piece 11 / the companion paper:** the owner's decision to proceed (VISION Update 24); T30 and T32 on Batch with her
  predictions; the exploratory window scan for T28 on the laptop. The gravity test's exact rungs need no gate.

### 25 September, morning: the four-direction test, and T26's verdict

- **T26 read: MELTS** (22 of 22 cells; corrected, O64: 27 cells, 26 melted, one healed). The owner's confirmed prediction failed. Piece 8's next form is six-link.
- **Piece 13 (VISION Update 25):** time as a fourth curled direction. T33 on Batch with her prediction (a tied pattern:
  three together from the three-curled start; four together or a singleton then three from the gas) and ours (one at a
  time). Exact before the runs (O50): the walls rise from rung to rung (doubling exactly at λ = 1.25 only) and the flat state's wall is 128, so a hot bath
  can drive a cascade in four dimensions without melting the flat state. A companion paper for the four-direction result
  would follow the three-direction one; neither is drafted.

### 25 September, morning: the overnight Batch results, read

- **Paper 1 / piece 2:** T24 INCONCLUSIVE by the letter for a third distinct reason; gate 3′ passed in all 28 cells; the
  rare long wait (24 to 76 τ) at small N is the thing to study next (O52). The edge break-up held a third time.
- **The six-link companion:** T32 FIXED WALL (16 at every size, sharp); T30 FIRST ONLY (the directions open one at a
  time; the gas of 6-cubes descends two rungs) (O54). *Corrected 25 September, midday:* the first direction opened
  fully in 28 of 84 torus replicas, partly in most others; the verdict is carried by the gas cell (O54, correction). *Corrected again (O64):* the gas is reported separately as
  registered, so the tori's verdict is NEVER OPENS. The reproduction gate: Gate C′ run A FAILS, run B ONE POWER; a
  factor of two matches the ordered side and the hot tail points at non-bipartite graphs (O53). The companion paper can
  now be drafted from T30, T32, O41, O49 and O50, with the open gate stated.
- **Who to ask, updated:** the model's author, one question: whether his 3D action sums over edges once (a factor of 2
  against ours) and whether his 3D graphs carry triangles and pentagons; the data to attach is O53's table.
  *Revised 25 September, evening:* held for when the six-link paper is ready for him to read (it would be the first he hears
  of our 3D work); the triangles-and-pentagons half is the weaker reading (O53 addendum).

## The (D, λ) map: what parameters lead to a burp, exact and measured so far (25 September 2026)

The owner's program (VISION Update 26): which number of directions goes with which λ, how interconnected the directions
are, and how the snap relates to the degree-of-freedom relationships. What is on the record, all at g = 1.5 for the
measured entries and exact for the walls. Every curled direction costs 4(λ − 1) per point, at every D (O41, O50).

| D (links) | Curled state | Stuck for now (exact wall > 0) | Wall at λ = 1.25 | Fixed with size? | Opening pattern | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2 (4) | one curled (the tube) | 1 < λ < 2 (wall 32 − 16λ); metastable at g = 1.5 for 1.05 ≤ λ ≤ 1.35 | 12 | yes, 48 to 192 points | one front, memoryless, the exact release; one relic | paper 1; T7 to T24 |
| 2 (4) | both curled (a gas of 4-cubes) | never above λ = 1 | downhill | | falls apart at once | O40 |
| 3 (6) | one curled (4 × L × L′) | 1 < λ < 2 (96 − 48λ) | 36 | | not run | O41 |
| 3 (6) | two curled (4 × 4 × L, L ≥ 18) | 1 < λ < 1.5 (96 − 64λ) | 16 | yes, 192 to 512 points (T32) | first direction fully open in 28 of 84, partly in most others (corrected); the second's wall (36) unpaid; near-flat only at a hot bath (T30) | O49, O54 |
| 3 (6) | all three (a gas of 6-cubes) | 1 < λ < 1.2 (96 − 80λ) | downhill | | at λ = 1.10: joins and opens two of three directions in 21 of 24, no rest between, never one space (T30-gas) | O41, O54 |
| 4 (8) | one curled | 1 < λ < 2.5 (160 − 64λ) | 80 | | not run | O50 |
| 4 (8) | two curled | 1 < λ < 1.67 (160 − 96λ) | 40 | | not run | O50 |
| 4 (8) | three curled (4 × 4 × 4 × 36) | 1 < λ < 1.43 (160 − 112λ) | 20 | | T33 running | O50 |
| 4 (8) | all four (a gas of 8-cubes) | 1 < λ < 1.25 (160 − 128λ) | downhill | | T33 running at λ = 1.10 | O50 |
| flat space's own wall | 2D: 32; 3D: 64; 4D: 128 (the same at every λ) | | | | a cold sheet accepts no move in any D | O22, O51, O50 |

What the map says so far (*ours*): the walls rise from rung to rung at every D (they double exactly only with eight links at
λ = 1.25; O55, correction), so nothing in the energy ties the
directions together, and the release of one rung in a cold bath does not pay the next; more directions widen the
window in λ for the partly curled states and raise the flat state's own wall, so a four-direction change can be driven
hot without melting where a two-direction one cannot. The "interconnection" the owner asks about is therefore not in this
energy; if it exists in reality it is an ingredient this family lacks, which is a thing the map can say plainly.

### 25 September, morning: paper progress

- **Paper 1:** a paragraph on the two 120-decay repeats (T23, T24) added to Sec. V, with the three different criteria
  and the rare long wait stated.
- **Paper 2:** Sec. 7 written from T25 (FREEZES IN, the survival table); abstract and discussion updated. Complete as a
  draft.
- **Paper 3:** T24 written in; a new section, "The same map across the number of directions", with the exact-wall table
  and the six-link measurements; the 3D window sentence corrected to O49.
- **Paper 4, drafted:** `docs/papers/black_hole/paper.tex`, "Does concentrated energy re-curl space? Three sealed tests
  ... and a melt every time" (O20/T21, T26, T27).
- **The six-link companion, drafted:** `docs/papers/six_links/paper.tex` (O41, O49, O50, T32, T30, the gas; the
  reproduction gate as its own section; the eight-link section left for T33).
- None has a PDF (Tectonic is not installed system-wide); all are American-spelled; none has been read by the owner.

### 25 September, afternoon: S5 moves; the owner's direction

- **Paper 1 submitted to arXiv with the model's author's endorsement** (the owner's report). His reading is awaited, not
  prompted.
- **The owner's direction** (VISION Update 28): other models with loop and exchange rules (`docs/design/loop_exchange_brief.md`);
  gravity as the target, at least directionally, at one λ (`docs/design/gravity_brief.md`); the (D, λ) map is groundwork for
  the new model.
- **Exact today (O56):** the one-switch curled column in six-link flat space is not a relic (120 units, not a dip); at fixed
  wiring there is no pull at a distance from energy or counting, as in two dimensions. The stable six-link relic is the
  first thing the gravity test needs, and it is not yet shown to exist.

## The two-week plan (written 25 September 2026, 13:12 ET, at the owner's direction)

The owner's direction of 25 September: run every claim at once, iterate each several times, use the rented machines
generously, read widely in parallel, write the papers here; do it by the book, because that is what persuades; the goal is
a body of work she can hand to physicists within about two weeks. What that means for each paper, as of today. "In flight"
means pre-registered and on the Batch queue.

| Paper (pieces) | Where it stands | In flight | Next iteration | What finishes it |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1, the burp (1, 2) | Submitted to arXiv; the window inconclusive by the letter three times, for stated reasons | T38 (the rare long wait: what the stragglers are) | A fourth λ map written with the owner's bar (a majority sharp at some size, stragglers reported), if she wants one | Her read of T38; a v2 with the stragglers explained |
| 2, the relic (5, 6) | Drafted; T10, T11, T17, T19, T25 on the record | T37 (many natural seeds; nucleation-and-growth with nothing fitted) | If long tubes end defected: does a defected space heal or last (a planted defected state followed in time) | T37 read and written in; the question of the defected end state answered |
| 3, the fertile window (4, 11, 13) | Drafted; the (D, λ) map table | T39 (the cascade window), T40 (the push in four directions), T41 (room for the burp in three) | The window's edges in λ with the owner's parameter questions (how many directions, what λ); a clean domain's size per seed against λ (from T37) | T39 to T41 read and written in; the map complete for two and three directions |
| 4, black holes (8) | Drafted; three melts in two dimensions; T34 melts at its first size | T34 (512 points), T42 (interchangeable points at λ = 1.02, the counting half) | If T42 folds: the packed protocol with interchangeable points, larger sizes | T34 and T42 read; the paper states which half of her mechanism this family can host |
| 5, gravity (7) | Drafted today: no pull at a distance in this family, and why (a gapped flat space); what a pull needs | Nothing: the next step needs her decision (gravity brief, section 6) | With option A adopted: two relics drifting together in two directions, then the 1/r shape in three, then clumping and re-curling | Her decision, then those three runs |
| six links (11, 13) | Drafted; the eight-link section written from T33 | T39, T40, T41 | T40's pattern at and above the true push | T39 to T41 read; the reproduction gate still open (a question for the model's author, held for this paper) |
| allotropes (12) | T36 read: none lasting on a torus | A construction being designed (a planted allotrope) | The planted allotrope's lifetime at λ = 1, the model author's own question | Its reading, sent with the six-link paper |
| quantum (9) | Weakest leg; the phase-per-swap form does not exist as stated | Nothing | Needs her decisions: the sign convention; whether to adopt a rule over histories | Her decisions |

**Compute.** The Batch environment runs 16 one-CPU jobs at once (about $0.78 an hour when full); the account allows 30. On
25 September about 140 jobs were queued (T37 to T42), roughly 150 CPU-hours, about $7. To use the budget the owner named
(at least $20 a day), the ceiling must rise: `terraform/batch.tf` `max_vcpus` from 16 to 30 and the deploy workflow run
(`deploy_manual`, "deploy"); that is hers to apply. Above 30 needs a quota request to AWS.
*Done 25 September, about 14:50 ET, with the owner's permission:* the live ceiling was raised to 30 through the AWS CLI, matching
the committed terraform (so a later deploy changes nothing).

**Decisions waiting on her, in order of what they unblock:** (1) the gravity rule (option A of the gravity brief:
a massless field on the points with relics as its sources); (2) the exchange sign's convention (points or pairs);
(3) confirming or replacing the predictions inferred for her in T36 to T42; (4) whether to write a fourth λ map with her bar.
