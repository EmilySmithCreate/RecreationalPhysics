"""T75's verdicts, read from the runner's rows (scripts/run_t75.py). Usage, naming every run read:

    python scripts/analyse_t75.py results/t75_n512_beside_g1p5.csv results/t75_n512_far_g1p5.csv ...

Implements the verdict words of PREREGISTRATION.md T75 as amended (Amendment 2, item 4), with the reader's choices
below fixed as written by Amendment 3, item 4. Per replica, records in order of fair time, D the diameter of the
replica's starting graph:

  healed    the damage is gone at the last record;
  confined  damage remains at the last record and R is never above 3;
  reached   R reaches D/4 (R >= D/4) at some record; t_reach is the first such record;
  travels   reached, with at most 8 points damaged at every record up to and including t_reach;
  jumped    a record marked `jump` at or before t_reach (at any record if R never reaches D/4);
  speed     for a replica that reached: the least-squares slope of R against fair time over the records from the
            first with R >= 3 to t_reach, both included (NaN if that stretch has fewer than two records).

Per cell (placement, coupling, size), 32 replicas, the first word that holds, in this order: HEALS (at least 24
healed), CONFINED (24 confined), TRAVELS (24 travels), SPREADS (24 reached), JUMPS (8 jumped), else MIXED. TRAVELS is
read before SPREADS because every travelling replica also reaches D/4. Whether at least 8 jumped is reported beside
the word whatever the word is, so "SPREADS, with jumps" can be read. The cell's speed is the mean of its reached
replicas' speeds, with its standard error. The flaw's cost (Amendment 3, item 1, and Amendment 4: the cheapest
valid switch at its point, beside a knot the cheapest touching no knot point, always above zero by Amendment 5; it varies from place to place) is reported beside every word: its smallest, mean and largest over the
cell's replicas.

Per (coupling, size), across the two placements of the flaw (Amendment 2, item 1: the second kind of disturbance is
the owner's to name, so this is read across placements of one kind): ONE SPEED if both cells SPREAD or TRAVEL and their
speeds differ by at most 20 % of the larger; SEVERAL SPEEDS if both do and differ by more; NO SIGNAL if neither does.
When exactly one does, the word is UNSCORED, said so (Amendment 3, item 4).

Prints the table. Nothing random; pure functions tested in tests/test_t75.py.
