"""The pre-registered T30 and T32 readings: the six-link curled torus, sealed. Usage:

    python scripts/analyse_t30.py

Implements PREREGISTRATION.md sections T30 (does one push open both curled directions; the room) and T32 (is the
activation fixed with size), written 2026-09-25 before the runs, on results/t30_*.csv and results/t32_*.csv.

T30, per replica (a 4 x 4 x L torus, two directions curled, H0/N = 8(lambda - 1)):
  the middle rung is reached at the first block with H/N <= 4(lambda - 1)(1 + TOL) and at least half the vertices
  at d >= 2; the flat state is reached at the first block with H/N <= 4(lambda - 1) TOL and at least CLEAN of the
  vertices at d = 3. A replica RESTS on the middle rung if H/N stays within +-TOL of 4(lambda - 1) for at least
  REST consecutive sweeps. Outcomes, from the final block: FLAT (reached flat), MIDDLE (reached the middle rung,
  not flat), STUCK (neither, majority of vertices still at d = 1 and fewer than MELT_FRAC melted), MELTED
  (at least MELT_FRAC of vertices at d > 3), OTHER.
  Per cell (lambda, N, C): the majority outcome. Per (lambda, N): C*, the smallest C whose majority is FLAT.
  Mechanism, over every replica anywhere that reached the flat state: CASCADE if it did not rest on the middle
  rung on the way; STEPWISE if it did.
  Verdicts: ALL AT ONCE if some cell has a FLAT majority and at least half of the flat-reaching replicas
  cascaded; ONE AT A TIME if some cell has a FLAT majority and fewer than half cascaded; FIRST ONLY if no cell has
  a FLAT majority but some cell has a MIDDLE majority; NEVER OPENS if no cell has a FLAT or MIDDLE majority (the
  spark bought nothing, or everything melted).

T32, per (N, spark): the share of replicas that ever left the start (S or X changed). The threshold E* at each N
is the smallest spark at which every replica left. FIXED WALL if E* is the same at every N; GROWS if E* rises
with N; FALLS if it falls; NOT READ if some N has no spark at which every replica left. SHARP is reported beside
it: at every N, nothing below E* ever left.
