"""EXPLORATORY, read-only (12 October 2026): the tube runs' end states that are not exactly flat. Usage:

    python scripts/read_leftover_width.py [results_dir]

Why. `read_endpoint_width.py` and `read_flat_kind.py` read the end states with H = 0, and found them six around.
About one tube run in six ends with energy left instead, resting on a leftover, and those were not read. T63's
control (12 October) hinted that they are not six around.

What is read. Every saved final graph of the tube runs T8, T23, T24 and T60 (the bath runs of paper 1's maps; the
sealed runs of T61 are another question). Each is put in one class:
    FLAT           every link on exactly two squares (H = 0 at every lambda)
    STILL A TUBE   more than a quarter of a surplus square per point left (the curled tube has one per point)
    LEFTOVER       the rest: converted, with energy left
and for each, `sees3`: the share of its points with exactly 25 points within three steps, which is what a point
of a flat sheet has. By the thresholds T61 to T64 use: WIDE if sees3 >= 0.5, TUBE if sees3 < 0.05, PATCHWORK
between. A point of a flat torus six around has fewer than 25, so an exactly flat tube six around has sees3 = 0.

A flaw changes the count of every point near it, so a count of 25 beside a flaw says nothing about width. So a
second number is read from positions: the points with **no flawed link within three steps** (a flawed link is one
not on exactly two squares). Round such a point everything it can see in three steps is locally flat, and then
the count is a statement about the tube there: 25 if no loop of six runs round it, 22 on a tube six around, 20
on the curled tube. These are the "clear" points.

What this is not. sees3 certifies no geometry and names no shape; a count is not a position. Nothing here is a
registered rule and no verdict changes. It reads results/ and writes nothing.
