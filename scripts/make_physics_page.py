"""Build the standalone web page for sidenerdapps.com/physics from the whole-account write-up. Usage:

    python scripts/make_physics_page.py

Input: `docs/public/the-loop-and-the-floor_v1.html`, the page exactly as published as an artifact
(it opens with <title>, a font <link> and its own <style>, and has no <html>/<head>/<body> of its own).
Output: `docs/public/site/physics/index.html`, a complete HTML document with its own head, sharing
tags, a canonical URL and public links in place of repository paths. The page has no JavaScript and
every picture is inline SVG, so nothing is fetched except two Google fonts, and the page renders with
fallback faces without them. Copy the output file into the SideNerdMarketing repository at the path
that serves /physics/ and let its publishing action pick it up.
