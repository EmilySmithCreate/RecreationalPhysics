"""T57: does too much concentrated energy curl flat six-link space under the owner's tie? Read by T34's rules. Usage:

    python scripts/analyse_t57.py [results_dir]

PREREGISTRATION T57 (written 2026-10-09, before any run). Reads `results/t57_*.csv` (scripts/run_sealed_curled_d.py,
T34's protocol with the table tie). The replica rule, the cell majority and the verdict words are T34's
(`analyse_t34`: FOLDED / MELTED / HEALED per replica from the final block; RE-CURLS / MELTS / HEALS / MIXED per
group), imported and not rewritten. What is new: the groups. The verdict is read per (tie, lambda), over that group's
cells (protocol, N, E); the tied groups are the test and the untied groups the control. Reported, not scored, as T34:
ONE DIRECTION and CASCADE replicas, the largest folded piece, melt-then-fold; and, new, the energy with the tie per
point at the end and the share of the spark left in the stores. Every six-link result carries VISION Update 24's
caveat.
