"""What does energy do to a sheet of space when it cannot leave? Usage:

    python scripts/run_sealed_sheet_budget.py configs/sealed_sheet_budget_lam125.json

EXPLORATORY (design track; TASKS T13 rung 3; the author's picture of a black hole). A black hole
is a sealed system: nothing leaves it, which is the fixed-total-energy setting of ASSUMPTIONS Q12.
The question it makes concrete is what concentrated energy does to flat space in this model:

  re-curl it   -- vertices whose local dimension falls to 1 or 0, a region folded back up, which
                  is the author's black hole and this model's X;
  melt it      -- vertices whose local dimension rises to 3 or more, a bubble of the random phase,
                  which is [T25]'s black hole.

The two cost different amounts and the difference is exact. At lambda > 1 a square added to an
edge that already carries two costs 4(lambda - 1) per added square; a square destroyed costs 16.
So curling is the cheaper damage per square, by four times at lambda = 1.25, and a budget that
cannot afford to melt may still afford to curl. The run measures which one the energy buys.

Each row is one replica at one budget: the budget per point, the demon (the energy still loose)
at the end, and the census of local dimension over the vertices. The sheet starts perfect, so
every vertex begins at d = 2 and any row that is not all-d=2 is damage the energy paid for.
