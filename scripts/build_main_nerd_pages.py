"""Build the web pages of the Side Nerd Blog at sidenerdapps.com/mainnerd/, one post per paper. Usage:

    python scripts/build_main_nerd_pages.py --tectonic PATH/TO/tectonic
    python scripts/build_main_nerd_pages.py --skip-figures            the pages again, the figures as they are
    python scripts/build_main_nerd_pages.py --skip-figures --only 1   post 01 alone, as if no other were written

Writes docs/public/mainnerd/:

    index.html                    the blog's front page: the list of posts, newest first
    comingsoon/index.html         where "next post" lands while the next post is not up yet
    assets/main-nerd.css          the stylesheet, shared by every post
    <slug>PL/index.html           a post's plain-language edition, chapter by chapter
    <slug>/index.html             its technical manuscript, section by section, where the post has that page
    <slug>Knobs/index.html        its interactive companion, where it has one
    assets/<slug>/                its figures (SVG), its PDFs, its mascot GIF and its share image

The posts are listed in scripts/main_nerd_posts.py. Post 01, "The curled torus burps", has the slug
01thecurledtorusburps, both editions as pages, and a companion made from docs/public/curling_ladder_tube.html.
A post is built once its plain-language source is in its paper's folder; until then it is skipped with a note, and
the post before it keeps the placeholder as its "next post". A PDF that has not been compiled yet is left off the
pages, with a note.

The pages are made from the LaTeX sources of the papers (docs/papers/<paper>/), so the text and the numbers on the
pages are the papers' own; nothing is retyped. Where a post has both editions as pages, each chapter of the plain
page links to the matching section of the technical page and back, so that the two can be read side by side. The
pages are plain static HTML, meant to be copied by the site's owner into sites/sidenerdapps/mainnerd/ of the Side
Nerd marketing repository. Their links are root-absolute (/mainnerd/...), so preview them with a web server rooted
at docs/public:   python -m http.server --directory docs/public   then open http://localhost:8000/mainnerd/

Needs Tectonic (to render the figures) and PyMuPDF (to turn them into SVG). The figures of a plain edition are
drawn in its LaTeX source; they are compiled once more with the `preview` package, which puts each figure on its
own tightly cropped page.
