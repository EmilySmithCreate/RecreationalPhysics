"""Read T67 (PREREGISTRATION T67, written 2026-10-16 before any registered run). Usage:

Per replica, from its records in order: the FIRST ESCAPE sweep = the first record with curled < N; the FRONT sweep =
the first record whose largest open region exceeds N / 2 while damaged <= N / 10; the COMPLETION sweep = the first
record with open >= 0.9 N. The replica's word: OPENS if it completed with damaged <= N / 10 at that record; FRONT if a
front sweep exists but no completion; BREAKS if damaged exceeded N / 10 before any front; SITS otherwise (the run
ended with neither). Per cell (mode, C, rate, N): the word held by more than half the replicas, else MIXED; the
median stop sweep; the median energy fed at the stop. Per size: OPENS if any cell reads OPENS or FRONT (the slab can
be opened by a feed at that size), else BREAKS if every cell reads BREAKS, else MIXED. Reported, not scored: the first
escape sweeps, the number of open regions at the stop, the end census, the store mean at the stop.
