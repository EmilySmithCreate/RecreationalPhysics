"""T52: what does a cut hide? The hidden count round the relics of saved end states, exact. Usage:

    python scripts/exact_hidden_relics.py configs/t52_hidden_relics.json [out_dir]

Implements PREREGISTRATION.md section T52 with its Amendment 1 (both written 2026-10-05, before any count was taken
on a saved state with `graphity.hidden`). For every saved end state named by the config's `states` pattern:

  relic windows   every four-point relic (T37's column: a connected piece of four points all at d = 1) gets the
                  ball of graph distance r for each r in `radii_all`; the `first_per_state` relics of lowest vertex
                  number get each r in `radii_first` as well;
  flat controls   the first `flat_squares_per_state` squares, in order of their lowest vertex number, all of whose
                  points lie at graph distance at least `flat_distance` from every point not at d = 2, get each r in
                  `radii_all`; the first `flat_first_per_state` of them get each r in `radii_first` as well.

A window is the set of points within graph distance r of its four anchor points. Its hidden count is
`graphity.hidden.hidden_count`: the valid wirings of the window's inside that leave every link with an end outside
untouched and the whole graph's energy what it was (ASSUMPTIONS O87). What is scored is `shapes`: those wirings counted
up to renaming of the window's points that have no link out of it (Amendment 1). A radius in `radii_all` is counted in
full, with the wirings at every other energy; a radius in `radii_first` at the original's energy only, one wiring per
class of renamings (`same_energy_only`, `fold_renamings`), which is exact for the count and the shapes. Nothing is
sampled; no random number is drawn.

The time limit. The search is one compiled call and cannot be stopped from inside, so each window is counted in a
process of its own (`--one`, below) and abandoned after `time_limit_s` seconds: its row then says counted = False.
