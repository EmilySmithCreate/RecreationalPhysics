([Bia24]; the passages used were read from the arXiv HTML on 10 October 2026). It is the discrete form of her
"Gravity from entropy" (arXiv:2408.14391). The paper works on a cell complex of nodes, links and polygons with the
wiring held fixed, and names letting the wiring change as open ("leaving the discussion about the possible implied
dynamics of the network topology to future works", Sec. 3.1). This project's networks change their wiring and count
squares, so its arrangements can be handed to her action as they are: nodes, links, and every square as a 2-cell.

What is taken from the paper (Sourced):
  d = G^(-1/2) B^T G^(1/2) and D = d + d^T, the Dirac operator                              (Eqs. 23, 31)
  D^2 = L, the Gauss-Bonnet Laplacian, block diagonal in the Hodge Laplacians L0, L1, L2    (Eqs. 35 to 40)
  {D, gamma0} = 0, gamma0 = +1 on nodes and squares, -1 on links                            (Eq. 34)
  S+ = sigma Tr ln G + Tr G (ln G - ln G~) - Tr G, G the metric and G~ the induced one      (Eq. 41)
  with no matter and no gauge field, G~ = I + c0 L                                          (Eq. 52)
  her vacuum is G~ = I (c0 = 0), where the metric obeys -G ln G = sigma I                   (Eq. 65)

What is ours (unverified; the question put to her is whether it is the right reading):
  - every 4-cycle of the network is taken as a 2-cell, as the energy of this model counts them;
  - with c0 = 0, Eq. (65) makes every cell's metric the same number g, so the action is one number per cell,
    s = sigma ln g - sigma - g, times the number of cells, 3N + S on a four-regular network of N nodes, 2N links
    and S squares. It then depends on the wiring only through the count of squares;
  - with c0 > 0 the wiring also enters through the spectra. Evaluated here at the uniform metric G = I, where
    d = B^T and S+ = -sum ln(1 + c0 mu) - (number of cells), mu the eigenvalues of L0, L1 and L2. The metric that
    solves her equation of motion for c0 > 0 is not computed.
