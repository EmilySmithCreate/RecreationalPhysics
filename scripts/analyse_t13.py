"""The pre-registered T13 observables and verdict. Usage:

    python scripts/analyse_t13.py 196
    python scripts/analyse_t13.py 196 484 676

Implements PREREGISTRATION.md section T13 as amended on 23 September 2026:

  amendment 1  a jump is a move of more than 0.25 in phi between two couplings on a curve less
               than 12 % apart in g, which need not be neighbouring. The per-step value is
               reported beside it so both readings stay visible.
  amendment 2  equilibrium agreement is read within the starts that pass their round-trip gate;
               a start that fails its gate takes no part in the verdict, and its difference from
               a gate-passing start is reported as a diagnostic, not as agreement or disagreement.

ONE THING THE PRE-REGISTRATION DOES NOT SAY, AND THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT DECIDE. "A jump in a curve"
does not say whether the curve is the replica mean or each replica separately. It matters: replicas
collapse at slightly different couplings, so averaging them smooths a collapse that is sharp in
every one of them, the same way averaging hysteresis loops with different coercive fields erases
the loop. Both readings are computed and printed. Where they disagree the script says so and
returns INCONCLUSIVE with the disagreement named, rather than picking one. Deciding it is Emily's,
and the rules want it decided before the data it applies to is read.

WHAT IS MEASURED. phi = S/N against the coupling g, for protocol P (single chains, cold descent
then cold ascent) and protocol E (parallel tempering from two starts). The verdicts need two or
more sizes; a single size returns NO VERDICT however clean it is.
