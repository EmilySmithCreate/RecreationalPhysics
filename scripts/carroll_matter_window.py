"""T94: a window with stored matter in it, read through Carroll's reader. Exact.

Usage:
    python scripts/carroll_matter_window.py <stage>        stage is "stage1" (R = 3, 4) or "heldout" (R = 6)

THE RULE READ (the owner's, VISION Update 155): matter, energy and twist are stored between points of the same kind, which
are never linked; photons and gravitational waves travel between points of different kinds. T91 (scripts/carroll_reader.py)
put a share of information on the links only, which under that rule is empty space. Here a share is also put on STORED
PAIRS: two points at graph distance two with at least two common neighbours, which on the flat sheet are exactly the two
diagonals of each square. A share is given as the pair's reader distance in link units, alpha = (-ln x_m)/(-ln x_0):
alpha = 1 shares as much as a link, alpha = 0.5 more, alpha = 2 the same as the path through links (so alpha = 2 must
reproduce EMPTY; tests/test_carroll_matter_window.py checks it).

THE WINDOW is the same point set in every case, the unweighted ball of graph radius R round the center, so only the
distances change; the distances are shortest weighted paths in the whole graph. Then classical multidimensional scaling
and the registered count D_MDS, as in T91 (the functions are imported from carroll_reader.py).

CASES: EMPTY; UNIFORM (every stored pair of the torus carries a share), alpha = 1 and 0.5; PATCH (the eight stored pairs
of the four squares meeting at the center), alpha = 1 and 0.5. Pre-registered as PREREGISTRATION.md section T94.
