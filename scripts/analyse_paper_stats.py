NOT PRE-REGISTERED. Asked for by a reader's review of paper 1 (2026-09-24), run on data already
committed, with no new simulation; ASSUMPTIONS O42. Prints and writes nothing.

1. Are the waiting times exponential? The pre-registered test of "memoryless" was the coefficient
   of variation (PREREGISTRATION T7, T8), a coarse test. Here the whole distribution is compared with
   an exponential. Every time is divided by the mean of its own condition, and the pooled, rescaled
   times are compared with the unit exponential by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance D. Because each
   condition's mean comes from the same data, the textbook KS p-value does not apply (the Lilliefors
   problem). The p-value here comes from a parametric bootstrap that repeats the whole procedure:
   same conditions, same counts, exponential times with each condition's measured mean, recorded the
   way the runner records them, rescaled by their own means, 10,000 times. Sets:
   (i)  first exits of the perfect torus, recorded with no watch: results/cqg_tube_arrhenius_lam125.csv
        (to the sweep; twelve conditions, sixteen each) and results/t22_exits_n*_lam*.csv (to the attempt;
        six cells, forty each). T22's times are also compared with Eq. (2)'s mean itself, with nothing
        estimated, by the plain KS test.
   (ii) the pre-registered waiting times of T7 (results/t7_ and t7b_lam125_n*.csv) and of T8
        (results/t8_lam*.csv, stuck cells only, as the paper defines stuck). These are read in blocks of
        five sweeps and only after a 200-sweep watch, so the first possible value is 205. If the wait is
        memoryless, the time beyond 205, given that the torus was still there at 205, is exponential
        with the same mean; the test uses W - 205 for every W > 205. A torus that had already begun
        converting by sweep 200 is detected late by construction (its resting spread widens the
        threshold) and piles up just after 205; T8 records how far it had gone at sweep 200 (f_200), so
        T8 is also tested with f_200 = 0 only. T7 predates that column.
   (iii) the far tail at lambda = 1.05: how many of the waits there exceed 75,000 sweeps, against the
        number an exponential with the measured mean gives (Poisson).

2. Is the relic's position along the torus independent of where the change started? T11 applied the
   pre-registered shares (at the far side, at the start). The named test here is a randomisation test
   of the mean distance: each replica's leftover is rotated through every column of the torus with the
   start held fixed, which is what "the leftover lands anywhere, whatever the start" means, and the
   observed mean distance is placed in that null distribution (100,000 draws, two-sided).
