"""The ways out of the curled torus, counted the way the chain proposes them. Usage:

    python scripts/exact_torus_level.py

EXACT, no simulation (ASSUMPTIONS Q13 and O42; paper 1, Eq. (2)). Two things a reader of Eq. (2) asked
to see made explicit (2026-09-24):

1. Ordered proposals. cqg.run_chain draws a vertex of side 0 and one of its four slots, twice, so it makes
   (2N)^2 = 4N^2 equally likely ordered proposals, and the same two edges drawn in the other order give the
   same switch. Counted here from the perfect 4 x L torus: every distinct switch, sorted by (dS, dX), and how
   often the chain offers each kind per sweep of 2N attempts.
2. The level. Some switches change neither S nor X. They reconnect two neighbouring columns (the short
   4-cycles) at two opposite points, which is a reflection of the square: the torus is twisted globally, and
   is no longer isomorphic to the perfect one, but every neighbourhood looks the same. So the chain, while it
   waits, wanders a family of arrangements at the torus's energy. Eq. (2) counts exits from the perfect torus;
   this checks that every arrangement met along a walk of such switches has the same counts, and counts their
   symmetries (what interchangeable vertices would change; paper 1, Discussion).
3. What Eq. (2) leaves out. Every exit other than A and B, counted at N = 64 to 192. Those that break two
   distant edges at once are offered a number of times per sweep that grows with N; their exact contribution
   to the exit rate is printed for every condition the paper quotes a waiting time for.
