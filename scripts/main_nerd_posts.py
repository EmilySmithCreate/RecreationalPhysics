"""The posts of the Side Nerd Blog, sidenerdapps.com/mainnerd/, as data. A post is one paper, and what differs
from one post to the next is here: its number and folder name, where its LaTeX is, which editions it has, and the
frame text written for it (summary, question headings, quick answers, key terms). What every post shares (the page
shell, the advertisements, the stylesheet) is in scripts/main_nerd_site.py; the conversion of the papers' own text
is in scripts/build_main_nerd_pages.py.

The questions and answers restate the plain-language edition and carry its numbers; change them there first. The
headings that echo common searches ("What was there before the Big Bang?") are bridges to the paper, and each
answer says what the work does not show.

To add a post, write its Post below and put it in POSTS. A text block left empty is left off the pages, and a post
is built only once its plain-language source is in the repository.

CHAPTER_QUESTIONS_01 = {
    1: ("What was there before the Big Bang?",
        "Nobody knows. This chapter sets up one way to study the question without a time machine: treat space "
        "as one arrangement of something deeper, and ask what kind of change could have produced it."),
    2: ("Is space made of something smaller?",
        "Some physicists think so. This chapter describes one published model, combinatorial quantum gravity, "
        "in which space is a network of dots and links and nothing else, and then the toy this paper works in: "
        "a close cousin of that model with one knob turned up, not that model itself."),
    3: ("What existed before space?",
        "The author's hypothesis is that it was not nothing and not chaos, but a specific curled-up arrangement. "
        "This chapter builds a stand-in for that arrangement inside the toy model."),
    4: ("What could have set off the Big Bang?",
        "Unknown. In the toy model a change of this kind needs a push, and the push can be counted exactly: "
        "twelve units at the paper's main setting of the knob (λ = 1.25), the same for every size of tube "
        "tested."),
    5: ("What is a metastable state, or false vacuum?",
        "A state that is stable for now: it lasts until chance hands it enough energy to leave. This chapter "
        "predicts how long the toy's version waits, and checks the prediction."),
    6: ("Can space change phase, the way water freezes?",
        "In the toy model it can: a patch of the new arrangement appears and grows while the old one is still "
        "there beside it. This chapter watches that happen, says what the pictures do and do not prove, and "
        "reads what the tube turns into: a tube six steps around, not a wide sheet."),
    7: ("Where did the energy of the Big Bang come from?",
        "In the author's hypothesis the change itself released it, the way freezing water gives off heat. In "
        "the toy model that release, the burp, can be counted exactly and followed when nothing is allowed to "
        "leave."),
    8: ("Is anything left over from before the Big Bang?",
        "In the toy model something is: about one small scrap of the old arrangement survives each change. "
        "Whether anything like it exists in reality is not something a toy can say."),
    9: ("How do you test an idea about the universe with a simulation?",
        "By turning one knob at a time with the rules written down first, and publishing every setting, "
        "including the ones that failed. This chapter is that map."),
    10: ("Can a computer simulate the beginning of the universe?",
         "Not the real one. This chapter lists exactly how far these simulations go, where each stops, and what "
         "lies past each edge."),
    11: ("Is this a theory of where the universe came from?",
         "It is a hypothesis, with one mechanism tested in a toy model and no physicist's review yet. This "
         "chapter says what was learned and what would have to come next."),
}

BIG_QUESTIONS_01 = [
    ("What was there before the Big Bang?",
     "Nobody knows, and this work does not settle it. It tests one hypothesis, the author's: that space is one "
     "settled arrangement of something deeper, and that before the change there was a different, specific "
     "arrangement, curled up and stable for now. A toy model shows that a curled arrangement can give way "
     "sharply in a network of dots and links, with a countable push and a countable release. What it turns into "
     "there is a slightly wider tube, not a wide space. That is part of a possibility shown in a toy, not "
     "evidence about the real universe."),
    ("Where did the Big Bang come from?",
     "One hypothesis, tested here only in a toy model: the hot early universe is the energy released when an "
     "earlier arrangement gave way and space opened out, the way water gives off heat when it freezes. In the toy "
     "the release can be counted exactly and grows with the size of the system, while the push that starts it "
     "stays small and fixed at every size tested."),
    ("What was there before time?",
     "This paper cannot say. The toy model has no time in it: its clock counts attempted moves, not seconds. In "
     "the author's wider hypothesis, which this paper does not test, what came before space had order but not "
     "time as we experience it."),
    ("Is space made of something?",
     "Possibly. In the published model this work builds on, space is a network of dots and links with no "
     "positions at all, and flat space is one arrangement of that network. Whether real space is like that is an "
     "open research question."),
    ("Is this an accepted theory?",
     "No. It is a hobbyist's hypothesis, tested on a toy model with the predictions written down first, written "
     "with AI assistance and not yet reviewed by a physicist. The paper says exactly what was and was not shown."),
]

FAQ_01 = [
    ("What is “The curled torus burps” about?",
     "It is a plain-language edition of a computational physics paper by Emily Smith. It asks what a sharp change "
     "from one specific arrangement into flat space would look like, and tests each part of that picture in a toy "
     "model made of dots and links: what it costs to start, how long the wait is, what takes shape, where the "
     "released energy goes, and what remains."),
    ("What is combinatorial quantum gravity, and is this it?",
     "Combinatorial quantum gravity is a published model, built by Carlo Trugenberger, Christy Kelly and Fabio "
     "Biancalana, in which space is a network with no positions at all and the energy is a count of squares that "
     "acts as a curvature. This paper's toy is a close cousin of that model, not that model itself: it turns one knob, "
     "the price of a surplus square (λ), above the published value of 1."),
    ("What is a curled torus?",
     "A torus is a grid that wraps around in both directions, and every shape in the paper is one: flat (the "
     "sheet), curled (the tube) or knot. Curl one direction of the flat one until it is only four steps "
     "around and you have a tube. In the toy the tube has one large direction where the flat sheet has two, and "
     "it sits 4(λ − 1) units of energy per dot above the flat sheet: one unit per dot at λ = 1.25."),
    ("What is the burp?",
     "The burp is the energy given off when the tube's tight curl comes undone. For a clean change it is "
     "exactly 4(λ − 1) per dot, so it grows with the size of the tube, while the push needed to start it does "
     "not."),
    ("Does the tube open into a wide space?",
     "Not in this toy as it stands. Read from the saved wiring, the tube ends as a tube six steps around where "
     "it was four: flat at every dot, and still narrow. The toy's rule charges for loops of four and for nothing "
     "longer, so nothing pays for widening further."),
    ("How much energy does it take to start the change?",
     "Twelve units at λ = 1.25: the cost of the cheapest partner swap out of a perfect tube, counted exactly, the "
     "same at every size from 48 to 288 dots. In 320 sealed runs, no tube left with a budget below 12 and every "
     "tube left with 12 or more."),
    ("How long does the tube wait before it starts?",
     "Count the exits a sweep offers, multiply by the chance each is taken, and you predict the mean wait with "
     "nothing fitted. Across twelve conditions the measured mean wait divided by the predicted one averaged 0.98. "
     "The waiting is memoryless, like rolling a die until a six comes up."),
    ("What is left behind after the change?",
     "About one four-dot scrap of the old arrangement per sheet, holding 14 units, whatever the size of the tube, "
     "in the sealed runs with the most room. What the scrap does afterwards is the subject of the next paper."),
    ("Does this show how the universe began?",
     "No. A toy can show that a mechanism is possible or impossible within a class of models; that is the whole "
     "claim. The clock in the simulation is a sampling rule, not physical time, and no physicist has reviewed the "
     "work."),
    ("Was AI used to write this?",
     "Yes. The author used Claude (Anthropic) and ChatGPT/Codex (OpenAI) to assist with code, analysis and "
     "writing, and is responsible for the result. The predictions for the main tests were written down before the "
     "runs."),

    1: ("What happens in a sharp phase change?",
        "One arrangement gives way to another all at once and gives off energy, the way water gives off heat when "
        "it freezes. This chapter repeats, briefly, the sharp change the first paper studied in a toy model: a "
        "curled tube of dots that turns into a wider tube."),
    2: ("Is anything left over from before the Big Bang?",
        "Nobody knows. In the toy model a sharp change usually stops one small piece short of finishing. This "
        "chapter says what that scrap is, and that a change started in one place leaves about one, whatever the "
        "size of the tube."),
    3: ("How do defects form when a material changes phase?",
        "A change that starts in many places at once does not always finish cleanly. In the toy model more "
        "starting places leave more scraps, though fewer than one each."),
    4: ("Do defects heal over time?",
        "In warm surroundings the toy's common scrap does. This chapter holds one in a bath at three warmths and "
        "times how long it lasts."),
    5: ("What does it mean for something to freeze in as the universe cools?",
        "A leftover freezes in when its surroundings get too cold to heal it before it has healed. This chapter "
        "runs that race in the toy, one scrap at a time."),
    6: ("Does cooling slowly remove defects?",
        "Mostly, in the toy: cooled slowly enough, nearly all of the common scraps heal. But most of the leftover "
        "energy stays, and this chapter shows what the slow cooling did not touch."),
    7: ("What kinds of defect can a sharp change leave?",
        "In the toy, three, read link by link: a curled loop, a double loop and a twist. Each is stuck on its own, "
        "and none is a seam between regions."),
    8: ("Why do some defects never heal?",
        "One possible reason, seen in old runs and not yet tested: a scrap can be the joint between two stretches "
        "of different width, and a joint may not be removable while the widths differ."),
    9: ("Could something left over from the birth of space still be around?",

     "kinds: a curled loop of four dots holding 14 units, a double loop of eight dots holding 8, and a twist of "
     "eight dots of two kinds holding 20 to 30."),
    ("How many scraps does a change leave?",
     "A change started in one place leaves about one, whatever the size of the tube, from 64 to 288 dots. Started "
     "by hand in one, two, four or eight places it left 1.10, 2.15, 2.50 and 3.40 on average: more starts, more "
     "scraps, but fewer than one each. A tube long enough to start itself in many places left about one curled "
     "loop for every 400 to 480 dots."),
    ("Do the scraps last?",
     "The common one, the curled loop, heals away in every warm bath tried, in 500 to 80,500 sweeps of the "
     "simulation. If the bath cools first it is frozen in. The double loop and the twist were unchanged by every "
     "cooling run, the slowest lasting 300,000 size-fair sweeps; whether a slower one would remove them is not "
     "known."),
    ("What happened when many scraps were cooled slowly?",
     "The curled loops fell off a cliff: slowing the cooling from 10,000 to 100,000 fair sweeps lost two in "
     "three, and from 30,000 to 300,000 lost twelve in thirteen. The energy held in leftovers fell much less, "
     "from 4.3 percent of the burp to 1.3 percent, because the other two kinds stayed."),
    ("Which predictions failed?",
     "Three. That scraps would grow with the size of the tube. That the curled loops would fall gently as the "
     "cooling slowed, predicted by the author and by her AI assistants. And that the leftovers which survive "
     "cooling would be seams between regions, predicted by the author. All three are reported in the paper."),
    ("What is combinatorial quantum gravity, and is this it?",
     "Combinatorial quantum gravity is a published model, built by Carlo Trugenberger, Christy Kelly and Fabio "
     "Biancalana, in which space is a network with no positions at all and the energy is a count of squares that "
     "acts as a curvature. This paper's toy is a close cousin of that model, not that model itself: it turns one "
     "knob, the price of a surplus square (λ), above the published value of 1."),
    ("Does this show what is left over from the birth of the universe?",
     "No. A toy can show that a mechanism is possible or impossible within a class of models; that is the whole "
     "claim. The clock in the simulation is a sampling rule, not physical time, and no physicist has reviewed the "
     "work."),
    ("Was AI used to write this?",
     "Yes. The author used Claude (Anthropic) and ChatGPT/Codex (OpenAI) to assist with code, analysis and "
     "writing, and is responsible for the result. The predictions for the main tests were written down before the "
     "runs."),
