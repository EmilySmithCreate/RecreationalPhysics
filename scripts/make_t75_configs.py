"""Write T75's configs (PREREGISTRATION T75 with its Amendments 1 to 5). Usage:

    python scripts/make_t75_configs.py --couplings G1 G2 G3

The three couplings are required and are not chosen here: they are fixed by an amendment, read off the equilibrium
curve already measured for the flat sheet at lambda = 1.25, before launch. One config per (size, placement,
coupling): sizes N = 512 (T51's t51_l128_10k end states) and 1,024 (t51_l256_300k); the held-out N = 2,048 is not
written here (rule 14: its prediction comes first). Placements beside and far (Amendment 3, item 2, and Amendment 4); 32 replicas,
2,000 fair sweeps read every fair sweep. Seeds from SEED0 in the order written. Refuses to rewrite an existing config.
