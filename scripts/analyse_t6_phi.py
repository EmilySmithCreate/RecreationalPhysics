"""The pre-registered T6 observables, read along phi instead of along the energy. Usage:

    python scripts/analyse_t6_phi.py t6_lam0_n36

Implements PREREGISTRATION.md section T6 as amended on 21 September 2026 (amendment 1), and
makes no choices of its own.

WHY PHI AND NOT THE ENERGY. The energy H = 16(N - S) + 4*lambda*X is a sum of two integers with
two quanta, so which energies are reachable, and how many ways each is reached, is arithmetic
between 16 and 4*lambda. Where 4*lambda does not divide 16 the histogram grows teeth at the
period of that arithmetic, and a pair of teeth reads exactly like a pair of humps. S is an
integer with unit spacing at every lambda, so a histogram in S has no comb in it. This is a
property of the two coordinates, not of any result.

WHAT IS MEASURED, AND IN WHICH COORDINATE.

  The transition coupling and the free-energy barrier are read along phi = S/N: the coupling
  where the two humps of P(phi) carry equal weight, and the depth of the valley between them.

  The latent heat stays an ENERGY difference, because that is what a latent heat is. phi only
  says which sweeps belong to which phase; their energies are then compared directly. This is
  the one place where mixing the two coordinates is deliberate rather than sloppy.

REWEIGHTING. From the joint (S, X) histogram at coupling g, the distribution at g' follows by
weighting each (S, X) by exp(-H(1/g' - 1/g)). The guards from the energy analysis carry over
unchanged and for unchanged reasons: an unvisited S is not a deep S, a valley must beat the
counting error on the bins it is built from, and a reweight may not concentrate the answer onto
a handful of sweeps. The coarse-graining veto does NOT carry over -- it existed only to catch
the comb, and under phi there is no comb to catch.
